# ROBOTIC_NAVIGATION
Project Repository: Autonomous Robotic Navigation (Progress Log). 

## üìå Project Description
This repository contains the development and progress tracking of an **autonomous robotic navigation system**.  
The project focuses on implementing perception, localization, and navigation strategies using computer vision, object detection/segmentation, and motion planning for assistive robotics.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop a robust **autonomous indoor navigation system**.  
- Implement **object detection and segmentation** (YOLO, SAM, or similar models) to support localization and obstacle avoidance.  
- Integrate **path planning and control** for real-time navigation.  
- Track project progress and document advances in a structured manner.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** ROS2, OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Navigation2  
- **Hardware:** Robot platform (Raspberry Pi / NVIDIA Jetson / sensors / actuators)
